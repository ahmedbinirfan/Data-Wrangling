# Data Wrangling Project

Hey there! This is a simple project where I mess around with some weather data in a Jupyter notebook. It's all about cleaning, transforming, and playing with the data to make it useful. Nothing fancy, just straightforward data wrangling.

## What's Inside

- **Data_Wrangling.ipynb**: The main notebook. It loads some weather stats like temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and conditions (stormy, cloudy, sunny, rainy). There's dummy encoding for the weather types too. I basically turn raw data into something neat.


## Why This Project?

I put this together to practice data cleaning techniques. Think handling missing values, encoding categories, maybe some basic stats. If you're learning pandas or just want to see how to wrangle weather data, this might be handy.
